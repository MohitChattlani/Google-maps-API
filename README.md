# Google-maps-API
To sum up I have made the repository on whatever I have learnt using the Google Maps Javascript API.

To learn for yourself:https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/


Like how to do the basic stuff like rendering maps,markers,infowindow ,how to stylize them and other such stuff.
To run these files you simply need to download the stuff and open the html files you wish to see.
Feel free to peek into my code,test my code and even add more to my code if you will.
